# Math_Models_Research_Project
Attached are the various papers that the research is based on as well as any code that is need for this. 
Note that the "Cicle Cell" file is our first thing done that describes how a cell will go from a square and be forced into a circle using a phase-field approach.
The work in progress is the shao paper. I've gotten it to run, but it seems to not be doing 100% of what I expect.  need to figure out what the heck is going on :(
